### Instructions:

Frankly, just throw together all the ingredients for the respective component and you are almost good to go:

  - Let the dough cool down in the freezer for about 15 minutes after you've formed a nice, tidy ball.
  - Pre-heat your oven to 200 degrees celsius.
  - After the dough has cooled down create a thin foundation - cover it with another thinly sliced apple if you so desire - and then
put the filling on top, and the crumble on top again.
  - Let the whole thing bake for about 60 minutes.

This recipe assumes a cake without an enclosing, high backed outer rim.
So if you don't want a rimless cheese cake just double the amount of ingredients for the dough specified above.
