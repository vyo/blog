A super-simple recipe for wonderfully fluffy waffles. Just don't look at how much butter there's in there... =)

The following ingredients breakdown is for about 12 waffles.

```md
  - 100g sugar
  - 200g melted butter
  - 300g wheat flour

  - 1tsp baking soda
  - 300ml soda
  - 3 eggs
```

### Instructions:

Things are pretty straightforward here; melt the butter, mix it
with the sugar, and then the eggs.

Spike the flour with the baking soda, and add both to the mix.

The dough should be very heavy now, and is likely hard to properly
stir.

Slowly add in up to 300ml (about one can) of soda, depending on how fluffy you like
your waffles - the more soda, the fluffier!

### In a hurry?

You don't *have* to melt the butter, soft butter will do as well.
It sure makes the resulting waffles smoother and fluffier, though.

If you mix in cold butter make sure to at least break it up into
some chunks and mix thoroughly, otherwise the dough will have an
uneven texture and might behave oddly while baking.

### Sidenote

Substituting regular sugar with vanilla flavoured sugar or honey
works just as well - you probably will want to reduce the amount
somewhat.

You can choose any soda you like the taste of, as long as it is
carbonated - the more, the better!
Depending on your choice you might want to reduce the base amount of
sugar from `100g` down to something more reasonable.

Sparkling water can be substituted for soda, and the resulting
waffles will taste pretty much the same. The raw dough will not,
though, so keep that in mind and don't be surprised when tasting
during the process.
