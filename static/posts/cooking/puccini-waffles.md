These savoury waffles make for a great starter, part of a brunch buffet or even a main course. As an added bonus they look super cute when using a waffle iron instead of a pan to bake them out.

Make sure to add some dips for variety!

The following ingredients breakdown is for about 10 waffles.

```md
Dough:
  - 500g floury (/mealy) potatoes
  - 300g zucchinis
  - 100g flour
  - 3 eggs
  - spices (e.g. salt, pepper, coriander)
```

```md
Other:
  - 5 table spoons of olive oil (only when roasting the zucchini)
  - 1 table spoon of salt (only when cooking the potatoes)
  - 1/2 cup of milk (only when cooking and mashing the potatoes)
  - 2 table spoons of butter (only when cooking and mashing the potatoes)
```

### Instructions:

Peel, dice and cook the potatoes until they are very, very soft. Don't forget to add a healthy amount of salt!

While the potatoes are taking their sweet time, grate the zucchinis and heat up a frying pan with the olive oil.
Put the grated zucchini into the pan and let them roast at medium heat until they start having a nice tan.

The longer you let them roast the more pronounced their taste will be in the waffles, so choose accordingly.

The potatoes and the zucchinis should be done around the same time; mash the potatoes add in milk and butter for
extra creaminess.

Add in the roasted zucchinis, flour, spices and eggs and gently mix the dough.

You may now bake the dough just as you would regular, sweet waffle dough. Note that this will take a bit longer
than usual due to the potatoes and zucchini. Since the potatoes have been cooked and the zucchinis roasted beforehand
this affects only the texture - the waffles are prefectly edible in any state of baking-completion.

### In a hurry?

If you are short on time you may forego the cooking and roasting of the ingredients and opt instead to simply grate both
the potatoes and the zucchini and mix them with the other ingredients.

This will result in the zucchini taste being much less pronounced - if at all perceptible - and the dough taking
significantly longer to bake. You should also make sure to fully bake the waffles to completion since at this point
the dough is actually still raw.

### Sidenote

The technically correct spelling - and consequently, pronounciation - for this punny recipe should be `Pucchini`.
I will leave it up to you to decide whether the mental imagery this conjures is sufficient justification for playing the pun straight.
